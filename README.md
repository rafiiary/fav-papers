# fav-papers
Through printing and reading papers in the past few years, I've accumulated a stack of papers that is taller than myself (193 cm). So to combat this issue (and be more enviornmentally friendly), I've bought an iPad I will use to read, annotate, and keep all my papers in the same place. To help myself, or anyone else who wants to glance at the papers quickly and grab a gist, I will update the annotated papers to refer back to in the future.
